    "# Tensor Data-types and Important Parameters when creating them\n",

    "There are three main issues in deep learning computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tensors are not the right data types\n",
    "    - if you're trying to perform some operation between two tensors represented by different data-types, for example, one being float16 and the other is float32\n",
    "    - Also half precision tensors (of float16 data type) are faster in calculation than full precision tensors with dtype float32 (as 1 number is 4 bytes=32bits after decimal pt)\n",
    "2. Tensors are not in right shape\n",
    "    - You will encounter errors when trying to do matrix multiplication between matrices of two different shapes\n",
    "3. Tensors not in same device\n",
    "    - if you created a tensor with device type GPU for faster calculation and other with device type CPU and you try to do some calculation between the two, you'll encounter errors!\n",
